# NeuronNoob

Welcome to NeuronNoob, where I document my journey through the fascinating world of Deep Learning. This repository is a continuation of my Machine Learning learnings from the [CSE476-Machine-Learning-Lab](https://github.com/Ataullha/CSE476-Machine-Learning-Lab) repository.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find a collection of resources, code snippets, and tutorials as I delve into various aspects of Deep Learning. The content will cover a wide range of topics including neural networks, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and more.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute. Let's embark on this exciting journey together!


Happy learning! ðŸ§ ðŸš€
